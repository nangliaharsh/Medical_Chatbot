## **üè• Medical Chatbot - Abdominal Pain Assistant**



**Technology Used üõ†Ô∏è**
---


**Backend (The Engine Room):**



**Python:** The main programming language used to build everything.



**FastAPI:** A super-efficient "waiter" that takes requests from the website and brings them to the chatbot's brain to get a response.



**Machine Learning (The Brains):**



**PyTorch:** The foundational "engine" that powers the AI models.



Transformers \& Sentence-Transformers: These are like specialized toolkits. One helps the bot chat naturally, and the other helps it understand the meaning and context of sentences, not just the words.

‚∏ª

Service Layer (The Project Manager)

Location: app/services/
Main File: chat_service.py

Responsibilities:
	‚Ä¢	Message processing and routing
	‚Ä¢	Maintaining conversation context across messages
	‚Ä¢	Managing conversation history
	‚Ä¢	Generating smart suggestions
	‚Ä¢	Bridging frontend requests with AI model responses

‚∏ª

Machine Learning Layer (The Brain)

Location: app/models/
Core Technologies: PyTorch, Transformers, Sentence-Transformers

Main File: chatbot_model.py

Components:
	‚Ä¢	The Detective
Uses SentenceTransformer to interpret symptom descriptions and find the most relevant medical topic from the knowledge base.
	‚Ä¢	The Conversationalist
Uses GPT-2 to handle natural conversation, answer follow-up questions, greetings, and expand on a known topic intelligently.

‚∏ª

Knowledge Base (The Medical Library)

Location: app/data/medical_data.py
A structured file containing all relevant symptom information, causes, conditions, and medical definitions. The AI can only answer based on this data.

‚öôÔ∏è How the Project Works

‚∏ª

üß† Step-by-Step Workflow:

‚∏ª

üîπ 1. Initial Question:

You type: ‚ÄúI have sharp pain in my upper right abdomen‚Äù

	‚Ä¢	React frontend captures the message and sends it to the FastAPI backend.
	‚Ä¢	FastAPI passes the message to the Chat Service.
	‚Ä¢	Since it‚Äôs the first message, there‚Äôs no context.
	‚Ä¢	The Chatbot Model is invoked. It uses the Detective (SentenceTransformer) to find the closest matching medical topic ‚Äî say, ‚Äúgallstones.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	A brief summary about gallstones is generated and returned.
	‚Ä¢	Context is saved as ‚Äúgallstones‚Äù for the session.
	‚Ä¢	Response is shown in the React UI.

‚∏ª

üîπ 2. Follow-up Question:

You type: ‚ÄúWhat causes it?‚Äù

	‚Ä¢	React frontend sends the follow-up to the backend.
	‚Ä¢	Chat Service now includes previous context: ‚Äúgallstones‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	It asks the Chatbot Model to answer specifically about gallstones.
	‚Ä¢	The Conversationalist (GPT-2) retrieves causes of gallstones from the knowledge base.
	‚Ä¢	A precise, context-aware answer is generated.
	‚Ä¢	Displayed in the chat interface, continuing a natural flow.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Why It Feels Smart
	‚Ä¢	Remembers Context: Doesn‚Äôt repeat information unnecessarily.
	‚Ä¢	Follows Up Intelligently: Understands pronouns like ‚Äúit‚Äù in context.
	‚Ä¢	Dual Intelligence: Combines semantic search (Detective) with natural dialogue (Conversationalist).
	‚Ä¢	Frontend Power: Clean, modern interface enhances user experience.
